# NumberGuesser
.NET Number Guesser Console App using C#

A console application that greets the user, picks a random number using the random method, and then has the user guess the number it randomly chose until the correct number is chosen. For each guess the user places, the application returns with a message of either Correct! or Wrong Answer and  gives the oppurtunity to guess again if incorrect or to play again if the number has been guessed.
